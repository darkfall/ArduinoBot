"Disclamer:

WARNING !!!

This project was done without any basic intention of been shared.

This project was basically done by myself for myself, just for fun and without code checking/cleaning ... so, it might be full of bugs !

You can use it as is, following the rules of GPLv2, but do not expect any rewrite/correction of possible bugs.

THIS PROJECT DO NOT USE THE ARDUINO IDE !! => it is designed to be build on a unix environnement using the Makefile. (I use OSX, if other you should edit the Makefile and change some variables : path to avrdude, arduino libs, etc ...)

Description:

Just an Arduino Mega based 2 wheel robot piloted via bluetooth with a BTM222 module, it also as a implementation of an autonomous mode, but not finished to implement it completely.

The piloting software is for IPhone and was done under Xcode.
